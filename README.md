# reprojecting_era5

A minimal example of how to reproject ERA5 data using `xesmf`, `xarray`, and `dask`.

This repository includes a single script, `reproject.py`, which demonstrates how to perform lazy, efficient reprojection of ERA5 datasets using the `xesmf` library with full support for parallelized computation via `dask`.

## Requirements

- `xarray`
- `xesmf`
- `dask`

## Contents

- `reproject.py` â€” Code snippet for lazy reprojection of ERA5 data.

## Usage

This is a lightweight reference for incorporating reprojection into your own workflows. You can easily adapt the code to match your specific data and target grids.
